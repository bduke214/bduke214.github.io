## Understanding Gas Mileage 

-Using the `mtcars` dataset we plot can attempt to understand the relationship of various factors to gas mileage (`mpg`). 
-We plot weight (`wt`) vs. mileage (`mpg`) spatially along the x/y axes. 
-We visualize the number of cylinders (`cyl`) as colors and the amount of horsepower (`hp`) as the size of an individual point in the plot. 

## Visualizing the Data 
 
```{r plot, echo=FALSE} 
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly)) 
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg,  
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp, 
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg), 
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>% 
   layout(title = "Car Data") 
```
